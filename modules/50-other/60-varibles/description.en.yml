name: Variables
theory: |
  A modern website contains thousands of lines of styles. Styles for blocks, text, and small areas are often all in one place. Imagine this: there's a certain shade of red that we use in lots of different blocks.

  How convenient would it be to change all the values if you want to change the base color? That's right - we would have to find all the values within the file and replace them with new ones.

  For a long time this has been one of the main problems with CSS. With the advent of the standard CSS3, this problem is gone thanks to variables.

  Variables in programming - a small area of memory in which we store the desired value. This value can always be accessed from any available location.

  As in programming, in CSS, you can specify variables that will be available throughout the site development process. If variables are used, you can quickly replace some values with other values instead of having to replace property values manually.

  A variable is created using the `---variable-name` construct. You can choose the name of the variable yourself. As an example, let's create a variable `--main-color` that contains the base color of the pages. Let it be black:

  ```css
  --main-color: #000000;
  ```

  This simplicity hides the fact that variables have different "scopes"-areas of the file from which they can be used. This is a big topic, so let's talk about "global scope" only. This will allow a variable to be used in any area of the CSS file.

  To create a global variable, you need to specify it in a special construct `:root`. This is usually done at the beginning of the CSS file:

  ```css
  :root {
    --main-color: #000000;
  }
  ```

  You can now use a variable in any part of our CSS code. This is done with a special construction `var(--variable-name)`.

  ```css
  :root {
    --main-color: #000000;
  }

  .news-block {
    background-color: var(--main-color);
  }

  .left-sidebar {
    background-color: var(--main-color);
  }
  ```

  If we want to set a different shade of black, just change the value of the `-main-color` variable, and all changes will automatically apply to blocks with the `.news-block` and `.left-sidebar` classes

instructions: |
  Create a variable `--main-blue` and set its value to the color blue `#00bfff`. Set the variable to `:root`. Write the styles in the tag `<style>`
