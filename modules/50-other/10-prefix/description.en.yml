name: Prefixes

  CSS does not stand still and new rules are being added all the time. Before a property becomes an official standard, it goes through a long process of discussion and fine-tuning. Browser vendors also try to keep up with the times, and add support for modern features to new versions of their products.

  This is used to test and adjust the behavior of a property in browsers. If a rule is important, then later browser vendors will "agree" on the subtleties of using the rules and implement support in their new browsers.

  Many of the properties that you might think are standard have gone from an idea and partial implementation to a common property that you will use in your everyday work. So what happens when a new property comes along?

  1. It goes through a discussion phase. Developers agree on how the rule will work, what it will affect, and how it will affect the page
  2. Browser developers add functionality to the new feature to their product little by little. Usually, at this time, different browsers handle the properties slightly differently
  3. The property gets into the standard and all browsers begin to support it "officially"

  If items 1 and 3 are clear, item 2 is the most interesting. When the functionality is added, you can already start using the property with the following points in mind:

  1. The behavior may be slightly different in different browsers
  2. The property will not work in earlier versions of the browser

  In order not to confuse developers, properties which are not yet fully supported and are not part of the standard are designated with special constructions - prefixes. They help the browser to determine that there is a new property, and if there is an implementation for it, it will be executed. If there is no implementation, then the property will be considered invalid and ignored

  For example, previously the `box-shadow` property, which sets the shadow for an element, was under discussion and implementation. To use it, you had to additionally specify prefixes - small additions to the property that are specified before the property name. As a result, the CSS looked like this:

  ```css
  .shadow {
    -webkit-box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px 0px rgba(0,0,0,0.75);
    -moz-box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px 0px rgba(0,0,0,0.75);
    box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px 0px rgba(0,0,0,0.75);
  }
  ```

  You can see three references to the `box-shadow` property:

  * `-webkit-box-shadow` — property for a WebKit browser
  * `-moz-box-shadow` — property for browsers based on solutions from Mozilla
  * `box-shadow` — property without prefixes

  If the browser could not handle the `box-shadow` property, it looked for its `-webkit-` or `-moz-` prefix. If this is not found either, the rule is ignored. Now, using such prefixes will help you use the `box-shadow` property in the very old Chrome, Safari and Firefox browsers.

  You don't need to keep it in your head all the time. Many processes are already automated and adding prefixes is done automatically. In the future, you'll discover all the tools to do this if you do the layout. But it's important to know what prefixes are and how they help new and old browsers
