name: Text color
theory: |
  Highlighting a section of text in color is a common way to get a user's attention on a page. Various advertising banners are always trying to tell us about an incredible discount, or that the offer ends today. Just as such a highlighting can indicate important information that must be read.

  Using CSS you can set the color of the text for the whole page or for a small area. This is determined by the selector to be selected. The color itself is set using the property `color`, the value of which is a color.

  In this lesson, the color will be written in the format `HEX` - a hex color representation, where `#ffffff` means white and `#000000` black. For convenience, at the end of the lesson, will be left a link to the portal, where you can select any color and get its value in the format `HEX`. More about color models in CSS will be discussed in a future lesson.

  Create a paragraph and highlight one word in it. To do this, let's wrap it in a string tag `<span>` and give it an arbitrary class, with which we will select the element in CSS:

  ```html
  <p><span class="info">Attention!</span> Important information</p>
  ```

  ```css
  .info {
    color: #5263f3;
  }
  ```

  <div class="hexlet-basics-example my-3">
    <p class="m-0"><span style="color:#5263f3;">Attention!</span> Important information</p>
  </div>

  To set the text color for an entire page, you can use the `body` selector. The `color` property is inherited, so the color will be set for all text elements:

  ```css
  body {
    color: #333333;
  }
  ```

  In the editor, add an element `<span>` with the class `violet` and set its color to `#9400d3`. Use the tag `<style>` to include styles

tips:
  - You can select a color and get its `hex` code at [HTML Color Codes](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/)
