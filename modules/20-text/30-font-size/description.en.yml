name: Font size
theory: |

  Another way to separate sections of text is to use different font sizes. We have already seen that browsers style headings differently. It is the size of the text that separates the header `<h1>` from the header `<h2>` and so on.

  You can control the size of text in CSS by using the `font-size` property, which takes a numeric value and a unit of measure. For now, we'll use pixels as the unit of measure, although there are a few other important units that will be learned by the end of this course.

  ```html
  <p>Warning, this paragraph has a standard font size</p>
  <p class="warning">This paragraph has a font size of 24 pixels</p>
  ```

  ```css
  .warning {
    font-size: 24px;
  }
  ```

  <div class="hexlet-basics-example my-3">
    <p>Warning, this paragraph has a standard font size</p>
    <p class="m-0" style="font-size: 24px;">Notice! This paragraph has a font size of 24 pixels</p>
  </div>

instructions: |
  Add a paragraph to the editor with the `big` class and set the font size to 60 pixels. Add styles to the tag `<style>`
