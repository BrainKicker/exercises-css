name: Capitel
theory: |
  Capitals are a type of lowercase letters whose size is the same as (or close to) the size of capital letters.

  <div class="hexlet-basics-example my-3">
    <p>Text typed in plain text</p>
    <p style="font-variant: small-caps" class="m-0">Capitol text</p>
  </div>

  It is often used as a stylistic device. But there is also a practical side to capitals: they are commonly used to mark abbreviations, and they are also used in the first lines of a work to make it easier for the reader to "enter" the text after the title.

  To set the capitals, use the `font-variant` property with one of two basic values:

  * `normal` - normal writing
  * `small-caps` - capitel

instructions: |
  Add a paragraph to the editor with the class `small-capitals` and display the text inside the capitals. Add styles to the tag `<style>`
