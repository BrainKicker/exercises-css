name: Line height
theory: |
  Line spacing (interline spacing) is an important item when working with text. This parameter determines how much space there will be between lines.

  | Insufficient line spacing                                      | Optimal line spacing                                        |
  |---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | <p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 14px">Text with a font size of 14 pixels and 14 pixel line spacing</p> | <p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;">Text with a font size of 14 pixels and 21 pixel line spacing</p> |

  Note that the left-hand text is harder to read. This is due to the fact that the eyes do not "cling" to the line and the eye constantly moves from one line to another and back again.

  To set the line spacing rule `line-height` is used. The value is a number and a unit of measure. As with setting the font size, you can use different units of measurement, but in this course we use pixels. Other units of measure will be explored later

instructions: |
  Add a paragraph to the editor with a `line-height` class with a font size of 24 pixels and a line spacing of 36 pixels. Add styles to the `<style>` tag.

  Try adding long phrases to the paragraph and adjusting the line spacing to see how it affects readability
