name: Generalized rule for fonts
theory: |
  A convenient way to set font properties is to use the `font` rule, which lets you specify:

  * `font-style`
  * `font-variant`
  * `font-weight`
  * `font-size` / `line-height` (these two rules are written with a slash)
  * `font-family`

  Six different rules within one! This helps reduce CSS code and improve its readability. The mandatory ones are `font-size` and `font-family`. The rest can be omitted.

  An example of an entry with all possible rules: `font: italic small-caps bold 24px/1.2 Arial;`

  Suppose we want italic bold with a font size of 24 pixels from the Arial font family, then the rule in CSS would look like this

  ```css
  .text {
    font: italic bold 24px Arial;
  }
  ```

  <div class="hexlet-basics-example my-3" style="font: italic bold 24px Arial;">
    Bold italics with a font size of 24 pixels from the Arial family
  </div>

  Note the order in which the values within the `font` property are used. First come the style rules, then the font size and spacing, and then the font family. This is important, because if the order is different, the browser may not process the result correctly.

  When specifying the `font-family` property, it is also recommended to specify a universal font family. This is necessary so that if the user has no font, a suitable one will be chosen from those installed on their system. As with the single `font-family' property, all fonts should be separated by commas. The same applies to the font family.

  ```css
  .text {
    font: italic bold 24px Arial, sans-serif;
  }
  ```

  ## Using one or more rules

  This section applies not only to the `font` rule, but to all the generalized rules you will learn in the course. On the one hand, it seems that using a single rule reduces the number of lines that are used in CSS. This is true, but there are two major problems with using such properties:

  1. Remembering the correct order of values. When using generalized properties, you should always remember the correct order of values for the properties. This can be easy to get wrong in the early stages of learning. A good option is to use individual properties, but in the order in which they go in the generalized property. With experience you will be able to switch to one rule
  2. generalized properties override individual properties. If you specified `font-variant: small-caps;` in your code, and then applied `font: 16px/24px sans-serif;` for the same element, the capitel will be reset to the default

instructions: |
  Add a paragraph with the class `bold-text` to the editor and set the following rules:

  * Boldface
  * Font size: `24px
  * Verdana font.
  * Font family: sans serif

  Write the styles in the tag `<style>`
