name: Background
theory: |
  When studying CSS, we've already encountered setting a custom color for the text inside a block. But that's not the only option for setting a color - you can set it as the background for the entire block.

  Note, the area with the theory and the editor in the lessons are separated from the rest of the site with a white background. This is done not only for easy reading, but also for the eyes to quickly find the area with the main content. To set the background color uses the property `background-color`, the value of which is a color.

  You can use the familiar `hex` values as the color:

  ```html
  <div class="card">A card with white text on a purple background</div>
  ```

  ```css
  .card {
    color: #ffffff;
    background-color: #673ab7;
  }
  ```

  <div class="hexlet-basics-example my-3" style="background-color: #673ab7; color: #fff">
    A card with white text on a purple background
  </div>

instructions: |
  Add to the editor `<div>` with the class `background` and set the background color `#2196f3`. Write styles in the tag `<style>`

tips:
  - You can select a color and get its `hex` code at [HTML Color Codes](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/)
