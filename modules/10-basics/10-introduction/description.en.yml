name: Introduction in CSS
theory: |

  The HTML markup language course covered various elements that, by default, were styled: paragraphs were indented, links were color coded, headings were different in text size, etc. As a developer, you can change this design and add entirely new ones. Add a background to the text? Resize elements? Create an animation? You can do all this with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), the language that defines how HTML elements will look in the browser.

  The CSS course is a logical continuation of the [HTML course] (https://code-basics.com/languages/html). Many of the tags and concepts that will be encountered along the way have already been covered.

  The example below shows how to render text without using your CSS (i.e. using the styles your browser "puts in") and how to style a document using CSS

  ## Example of text with a standard layout

  <div class="hexlet-basics-example my-3">
    <p class="h2">Paragraphs</p>
    <p>Paragraphs are created with a paired <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag with a small piece of text in the body. For example:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;p&gt;First paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Second paragraph&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
  </div>

  ## Example text with custom design

  <div class="hexlet-basics-example my-3">
    <p class="border-bottom display-6 pb-2">Paragraphs</p>
    <p class="lead">Paragraphs are created with a paired <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag with a small piece of text in the body. For example:</p>
    <pre class="bg-light my-4" style="border-left: 5px solid #673ab7!important;"><code>&lt;p&gt;First paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Second paragraph&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
  </div>

  The text is now easier to read and you can quickly separate code samples from descriptions. The course will cover basic CSS rules for working with text and blocks, which will allow you to design the text and visually structure information

instructions: |
  Copy the code into the editor. Try substituting different values to see how the editor works. Tests expect a full copy of the code below

  ```html
  <p style="font-size: 25px;">The first style change with CSS</p>
  ```
