name: Selector by Class
theory: |
  The main solution to styling a particular part of the page is to use classes. They help us set the desired style is not just for all elements on the page, but only for those elements that have the required class.

  To specify a style for a class in CSS we use the selector `.name-class'. Note the dot - this is how the browser understands that this style is specified for the class.

  ```html
  <p class="paragraph">
    The text of our paragraph.
    It is with the class paragraph in CSS
    will set properties for this block of text.
  </p>
  ```

  ```css
  .paragraph {
    color: #333333;
    /*
      The color rule sets the color of the text.
      In this case it is gray with value #333333
    */
  }
  ```

  Since there can be many classes with the same name on the page, this rule will work for all elements with class attribute equal to `paragraph`

instructions: |
  In the editor, add a paragraph with the class `news` and specify the text color `#553333` for it. Connect the styles with the tag `<style>`
